- Nandan Park Ltd was pioneered by a group of forward thinking, like minded individuals, who took the initiative to launch the largest Family Amusement Park in Bangladesh, on October 3rd 2003.

- The growing need for recreational facilities for an ever-growing urban population in Bangladesh, demanded the birth of Nandan Park Ltd. 

- NPL, prides itself on the diversity of its visitors, no matter age, gender or nationality, all are welcome! NPL is unlike any other amusement park in Bangladesh .

- our visitors are the heart of everything we do, the safety and well-being of our guests are our top priority. Our staff offer unique hospitality in the hopes of providing a memorable experience. 

- We are honoured to welcome on average 1.2 million visitors annually, and look forward to having those numbers grow. It is with privilege that NPL is able to say that it has become Bangladesh’s ‘Premier Family Amusement Venue’ that too, within such a short space of time.
